According to the official docs, ~Emacs~ is an extensible, customizable,
free/libre text editor - and more. *Much more!*

At its core is an interpreter for *Emacs Lisp*, a dialect of the Lisp
programming language with extensions to support text editing.

Reference: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs website]].

** Install Using ~apt~

~apt~ is the package manager available for Ubuntu Linux (Debian based OS). To
install Emacs using this package manager is pretty straigh forward:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
  sudo apt install emacs
#+END_SRC

** Install Using Terminal

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
  # download emacs version 27.2
  export EMACS_VERSION="27.2"
  wget https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-${EMACS_VERSION}.tar.gz

  # extract the content
  tar xvzf emacs-${EMACS_VERSION}.tar.gz
  cd emacs-${EMACS_VERSION}/
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC

** Learning Elisp - Emacs Lisp

Since Emacs could be configured using Elisp it is totally useful to learn this
programming language in order to create new functionalities or even get more
familiar with this tool.

In order to learn this I'm currently using this reference: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html][(Book) Introduction
to programming in Emacs Lisp]].

After finishing this first book, I plan to read [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp][Paradigms of Artificial
Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp]].

** Cool Emacs Links

+ [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html#:~:text=Running%20the%20drill%20session][org-drill]] reference for running the drill session. This part of the docs is
  very good since it explains what each number means and how to run the session
  passing the scope to read our drills.
  - Before publishing an org-drill deck we should use ~org-drill-strip-all-data~
    to remove personal scheduling data.
  - This is currently my favorite tool along with ~org-mode~.
