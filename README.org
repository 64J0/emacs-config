According to the official docs, ~Emacs~ is an extensible, customizable,
free/libre text editor - and more. *Much more!*

At its core is an interpreter for *Emacs Lisp*, a dialect of the Lisp
programming language with extensions to support text editing.

Reference: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs website]].

** Install Using ~apt~

~apt~ is the package manager available for Ubuntu Linux (Debian based OS). To
install Emacs using this package manager is pretty straigh forward:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
  sudo apt install emacs
#+END_SRC

** Install Using Terminal

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :tangle no
  # download emacs version 27.2
  export EMACS_VERSION="27.2"
  wget https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-${EMACS_VERSION}.tar.gz

  # extract the content
  tar xvzf emacs-${EMACS_VERSION}.tar.gz
  cd emacs-${EMACS_VERSION}/
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
#+END_SRC

** Learning Emacs

According to [[http://tilde.town/~ramin_hal9001/articles/2022-04-27_best-way-to-learn-emacs.html][this post]], the best way to learn Emacs consists in two things:

1. Read blog posts about how other people use Emacs;
2. Learning how to read the manual.

*** 1. Some Blogs

Later in this ~README.org~ I cite other cool articles and references. Here I'll
just store the non-exhaustive links mentioned by Ramin in his article.

*** 2. Emacs Manual - Cheatsheet

+ ~C-h i~ - *open the Info-mode* app, which lists a "menu" of all installed
  manuals.
+ ~C-h r~ - *read manual*, jumps straight to the Emacs manual table of contents.
+ ~q~ - *quit*, hides the manual and goes back to where you were before reading
  the manual.

Those are the points I think are worth knowing, at least in the beginning.

** Learning Elisp - Emacs Lisp

Since Emacs could be configured using Elisp it is totally useful to learn this
programming language in order to create new functionalities or even get more
familiar with this tool.

In order to learn this I'm currently using this reference: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html][(Book) Introduction
to programming in Emacs Lisp]].

After finishing this first book, I plan to read [[https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp][Paradigms of Artificial
Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp]].

** Cool Emacs Links

+ [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html#:~:text=Running%20the%20drill%20session][org-drill]] reference for running the drill session. This part of the docs is
  very good since it explains what each number means and how to run the session
  passing the scope to read our drills.
  - Before publishing an org-drill deck we should use ~org-drill-strip-all-data~
    to remove personal scheduling data.
  - This is currently my favorite tool along with ~org-mode~.
